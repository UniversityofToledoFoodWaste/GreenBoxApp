<p><strong>Emily Briese:</strong>
	I am currently a junior environmental engineering student with a focus on renewable energy production, consumption, and sustainability. Additionally, I believe this field has the capacity to assist in the growth of food, in both urban and rural settings. I have experience with the incorporation of both of these components in my work on Photovoltaics and the water and solar energy nexus as well as work on virtual water and urban agriculture. I have just returned from conducting research at The Autonomous University of Barcelona's Institute of Environmental Science and Technology (ICTA-UAB).
